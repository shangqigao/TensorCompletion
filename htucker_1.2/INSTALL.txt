INSTALLATION of the htucker toolbox
-----------------------------------

1. Unpack the compressed file htucker_toolbox_1.2.zip. This should create
   a directory htucker_1.2.

2. Open MATLAB and change into the directory htucker_1.2.

3. Execute the following commands within Matlab

     addpath(pwd)
     cd examples; addpath(pwd)
     savepath %<-- Save path for future MATLAB sessions.
              %    This may not work for all installations of Matlab.

Compatibility with Tensor Toolbox
---------------------------------

Much of the functionality of this toolbox is similar to the Tensor
Toolbox, so it is possible to use both concurrently. Note that the htucker
toolbox does not make use of the tensor class in the Tensor Toolbox, but
uses standard MATLAB multi-dimensional arrays instead.

Compatibility with MATLAB versions
----------------------------------

This toolbox requires MATLAB Version 7.6 (R2008a) or later. It has
been tested under Linux, with MATLAB Versions 7.6 (R2008a) and 7.14 (R2012a).

Getting started
---------------

Run test_functions to check the validity of the installation.

Try some of the demos in the directory examples.
